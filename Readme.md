Assignment Questions:
1) What is the difference between null and undefined?

   
Answer:  Undefined means a variable is declared but value is not assigned.  On the other hand,null means a variable is intentionally given an empty value.


2) What is the use of the map() function in JavaScript? How is it different from forEach()?

Answer:
Use of map() in JavaScript:
                 1.map() creates a new array
                 2.It transforms each element

Use of forEach():
                1.forEach() is used to loop
                2.It does not return a new array

Difference between map() & foreach(): 
map() → returns a new array
forEach() → returns undefined
